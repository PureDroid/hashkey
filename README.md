## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables
- **organizations** - Group your accounts by organization
- **accounts** - Store encrypted account credentials
- **audit_log** - Track all changes for security
- **master_password** - Secure access control
- **settings** - Application configuration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PureDroid/hashkey.git
cd hashkey
```

2. **Build the project**
```bash
mvn clean install
```

3. **Run the application**
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.puredroid.hk.Main"
```

### First Time Setup
On first launch, you'll be prompted to:
1. Create a master password (choose wisely - this cannot be recovered!)
2. Create your first organization
3. Start adding accounts

## 🔧 Configuration

Database location: `~/.hashkey/passwords.db`

Settings can be configured in the application:
- Clipboard timeout duration
- Auto-lock timer
- Password generator defaults

- Never stored in plain text
- Salted and hashed using Argon2id
- Failed attempt tracking with automatic lockout

### Audit Trail
- Every create, update, delete operation logged
- Old values preserved for rollback capability
- Timestamps for all changes
